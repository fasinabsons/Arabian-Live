 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
 but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other
  kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away
  your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
  a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
  Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software;
  it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
  it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
  Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
  copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source
  code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
  of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  [The full text of the GNU GPL v3 is quite lengthy. For brevity, I’ll include the
  key introductory portions and instructions here. The complete text can be found at:
  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>. Below is how your LICENSE file might
  begin, followed by a reference to the full terms.]
